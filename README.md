Riemann Sum Visualization for Integration Learning
This project provides an interactive visualization tool for understanding integration through Riemann sums, built with React and modern web technologies.
Project Overview
This interactive web application helps visualize the fundamental concept of integration using Riemann sums, specifically demonstrating how to calculate the area under y = x².
Live Demo: https://rehmanfayyaz362.github.io/understanding-intigration/
Features

Interactive sliders to adjust:

Number of rectangles (n) for better approximation
Width of the integration interval [0, x]


Real-time visualization of:

Rectangles approximating the area
Actual curve (y = x²)
Individual rectangle dimensions


Dynamic calculations showing:

Approximate area (Riemann sum)
Actual area (∫₀ˣ t² dt = x³/3)
Error between approximate and actual values
